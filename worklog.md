Task ID: 1
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Analyze Karma Space /docs failure and implement fixes

Work Log:
- Analyzed chat transcript showing /docs command failing: AI loops on web_search calls, auto-routes to SambaNova 3x, never generates documents
- Identified root cause: /docs prompt forced 5 tool calls (get_project_info, list_projects, 3x web_search) before writing anything
- web_search tool is knowledge-based stub that returns "use your training knowledge" — wastes entire agentic loop rounds
- Previous session's fixes were already applied (one-doc-at-a-time, max_tokens uncapped, history reduced, DOC_AUTO_MODEL=glm-4-flash) but prompt still forced tool usage
- Fix 1: Removed web_search from doc command tool filter in route.ts (only list_projects + get_project_info remain)
- Fix 2: Redesigned /docs prompt — removed "Step 1: Gather Data Using Tools" with 5 mandatory tool calls
- Fix 3: Added "IMPORTANT: WRITE THE DOCUMENT NOW" directive that explicitly says "Do NOT call any tools"
- Fix 4: Updated individual doc commands (/prd, /trd, etc.) with same "WRITE NOW" directive
- Fix 5: Removed web_search from system prompt tool list
- Fix 6: Reduced MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS from 8 to 4 for doc commands
- Fix 7: Updated /help text to reflect new /docs behavior (generates overview + PRD immediately)

Stage Summary:
- Modified files: src/app/api/ai/chat/route.ts, src/lib/ai-prompts.ts
- Key insight: The AI was wasting entire agentic loop rounds on fake web_search calls instead of generating content
- New behavior: /docs will produce the Project Overview + PRD in a single response with zero tool calls
- web_search tool still exists for general chat (knowledge-based research), just filtered out for doc commands
